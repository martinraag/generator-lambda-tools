This repository contains [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io) generators for [@testlio/lambda-tools](https://github.com/testlio/lambda-tools) package. The provided generators help set up a new service, as well as add functionality to an existing service.

While usable directly via `yo`, the generators in this repository are also directly used in lambda-tools to provide a single point of interaction.
